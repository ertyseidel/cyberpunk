sb4 jnct

You come to a corridor with three closed doors. The only light here is a single, buzzing flourescent light which reflects off the tile underfoot. The air here feels cold, and you hear the humming of electronic equipment through the walls.

if (started_banging):
    The banging noise is louder now! You hear it, still somewhat muffled, behind door sb2.

if(not visited jnct)
    You hear the small whine of the security camera posted above the second door as it focuses on you.

set (turned on sb4 rm 1 light)

It's some sort of office: papers and cables spill over the desks that line the outer walls of the room.

If not opened sb2:
    You hear a muffled banging sound, as though someone is pounding on a door back at the junction.

sb4 rm 3 examine door

This door is heavier than the others, a black steel frame surrounding a red-painted door. You see a larger, more complicated keycard reader. It looks like you'll also need a fingerprint to grant access.

A small placard centered on the door reads "AIRT Mainframe - Priveleged access only".
